Dairy product worldwide can be classified into 5 main category[^1], with milk being majority of volume in production. However those production always do not align with export as milk and some cheese, butter have short shelf-life, thus introducing geological factor in exporting.
We will be primarily discussing Cow milk, cheese and butter in this document, with year 2022 and 2023.

## Cow Milk

Leading cow milk producers globally is EU-27[^2], followed by United States and India. Its should be noted that those do not correlate to exports, as US and India have high self-consumption rate, especially India. Directly comparing the produce and export, we can see that in fact, New Zealand has highest exports(in U.S. dollars)[^3] followed by Germany.
We can hypothesize that New Zealand is the leading exporter due to it's population size, not because of cultural reasons.

It should be noted that large portion of milk consumption could be from 2nd products such as butter or cheese, and may not directly align with actual consumption.
