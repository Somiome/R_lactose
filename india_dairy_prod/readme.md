# Case Study: India

## India

India have about 65% of lactose intolerance, however it has the largest domestic consumption of fluid milk of 87MMT from 2023. The trend is everso growing since.

Northern Indians have lower lactose intolerance rate, averaging about 1/3 of population while southern indians have higher rate with 2/3 of population being affected.

And it is 3rd most larest producer of cow milk(Emphasis on cow milk), with 99.5MMT in 2023.

In 2023, India produced 99.5MMT of cow milk, and approximately 92MNT of Buffalo milk, with the percentile of buffalo milk in total milk production growing.

Despite the large production, India is not a major exporter of milk, or considering it's consumption, it is not a major importer either. The country is near self-sufficient in milk production.

### Fluid Milk Chain

Comparing the numbers, the domestic consumption of dairy milk is almost identical to production of cow milk, but accountign for all milk source, domestic consumption is approximately half of total consumption. The rest is processed into other dairy products including ghee, cheese, ...ect.

### Secondary Products

India is also the largest producer in butter industry, accounting for 6750000MT in 2023

### Actual population consumption

India, while it's domestic consumption and calory consumption is high, is not the highest in (fluid) milk per capita. In fact, per 2013 study it ranks at 99th in the world.

And study(Gallego Romero et al., 2012) Suggest that one of factor in lactase persistence, -13910C>T is distributed mostly in northern india, whereas southern india has higher lactose intolerance rate. The study suggest a shared origin for the mutation in India and Europe, and that due to sociological factor, there were positive selection toward lactose persistance in northern India.

Which would suggest that people consumed milk in place for animal protein, hence lower positive selection towards eastern/southern regions in India.
